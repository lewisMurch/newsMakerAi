Public version of my private automatic news maker

Please resuse anything you want, individual files should work well for your project with minimal tweaking. Thought I would release as this is something I would have liked to have had 6 months ago when I started the project for help and ideas with certian things.

I have included some example videos to show capabilities of the private version (very similar to this one, just with my own custom blender files and API keys basically) 

Needs lots of modules and software otherwise full pipleine won't work like mine, but this is intended as a source for more indivudal files, and less as a full project (although feel free to get it to work if you want).  A few files are missing as they are too big (such as some of the blender files).

I am aware there are more efficent, better, and more secure ways of doing most things here... but this is a perosnal project for fun so I don't think it is that important.
